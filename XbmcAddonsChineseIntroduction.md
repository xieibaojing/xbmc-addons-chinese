In order to use these plugin you will need the latest stable Dharma or Eden of XBMC. Certain plugins are supported on 9.11 camelot.

Note: We have changed the repository structure due to a recent new release of XBMC Eden. You must uninstall the older version of "Chinese Add-on Repository", and reinstall the downloaded zip file that is for your xbmc version.
```
 * Install file for Dharma: repository.googlecode.xbmc-addons-chinese-dharma.zip
 * Install file for Eden: repository.googlecode.xbmc-addons-chinese-eden.zip
```

Some of the Add-ons use Chinese Keyboard for text entry; you will also need to install the Chinese-Keyboard module from the zip file below:
```
 * Install file for Dharma: script.module.keyboard.chinese-1.2.4-eden.zip
 * Install file for Eden: script.module.keyboard.chinese-1.2.4-eden.zip
